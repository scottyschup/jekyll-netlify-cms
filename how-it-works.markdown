### How MAC Works
 
MAC is a practical abortion fund. We do not provide financial assistance for abortion proceduresâ€”instead, we assist with the other costs and difficulties associated with getting an abortion. If you are traveling to, from or within the Midwest to access safe and legal abortion services, we host and help with transportation.

This includes:
 
**<b>Travel Costs</b>**

If you are traveling for an abortion from another city or state (or even across a city), we can help ease your journey. MAC can book your bus or train ticket to get to the city, or reimburse your gas money.  Additionally, a MAC volunteer can meet you at the bus or train station and escort you to a volunteer's home where you will stay during your visit.

**<b>Accommodation</b>**

Our volunteers help eliminate the costly expense of staying in a hotel by assisting with lodging. It is our goal to make your stay go as smoothly as possible.

**<b>Additional Costs</b>**

MAC also helps reduce costs of food and medication.

**<b>If you're a minor...</b>**

There are laws relating to parental involvement for those under the age of 18 who seek to obtain an abortion in Illinois. Minors who need information about the law or help to get an abortion without telling a parent can contact the [Judicial Bypass Coordination Project](http://ilbypasscoordinationproject.org/).
