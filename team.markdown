MAC is a volunteer-run, 501(c)3 non-profit organization. As a grassroots, community-funded organization, weâ€™re always looking to grow our network.

You can [connect with our coalition](connect.html) by following us on social media, signing up for our mailing list, volunteering, or attending our next event!

We strongly encourage people of color, gender nonconforming folks, and individuals with disabilities to apply to volunteer with us.
