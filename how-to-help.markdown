### Want to get involved with MAC's cause? Joining our coalition is as simple as connecting with us on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/midwestaccesscoalition/), signing up for our [mailing list](connect.html), [volunteering](volunteer.html), or attending our next event.

### [Volunteer with us!](volunteer.html)

We host volunteer trainings on an ongoing basis and are always looking to grow our network. We need drivers and hosts to open up their homes. If you cannot volunteer in those capacities, we also will gladly take on volunteers to assist with fundraising. If you have another skill that you'd like to share with us, we would love to hear about it!

### Why should I volunteer?

* To make a positive change in the world
* To make someone’s life just a little bit easier
* To foster a community that empowers people choosing the best reproductive choice for themselves
* To attend our rad annual volunteer appreciation parties

### Not sure about volunteering? Donate instead!

As we're a grassroots, community-funded organization, making a donation is also a great way to help MAC!
