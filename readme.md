## Local dev cycle
```
firebase login
```
If you don't have the login credentials, contact nicole@midwestaccesscoalition.org to receive them through LastPass.

If you don't have LastPass installed, you can do so [here](https://lastpass.com/misc_download2.php).

To run firebase app locally:
```
# If you just need to view the site locally run
jekyll build

# Else if you plan on making changes to the site and want to see your changes update automatically, run the following and leave it open
jekyll serve

firebase serve # This command must be run regardless of which option you chose above
```
If you run `firebase serve` and get this error message: `Error: Unable to authorize access to project mac-site`, then try running `firebase use --add` and select `mac-site` when prompted. Give it the alias "default".

If `mac-site` doesn't appear as an option, then contact <nicole@midwestaccesscoalition.org>.

## Deploy
```
firebase deploy
```
This will deploy whatever branch you're on locally to production. If this fails and mentions something about database rules, it likely means you don't have write access and should contact <nicole@midwestaccesscoalition.org>.

* Local URL: http://localhost:5000/
* Firebase URL: https://mac-site.firebaseapp.com

You can access the Firebase console at https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/mac-site/overview.
