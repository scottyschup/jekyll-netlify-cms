### If you're pregnant, but don't want to be, MAC can help.
### Call us at **[847-750-6224](tel:+18477506224)**, or send us an email at [support@midwestaccesscoalition.org](mailto:support@midwestaccesscoalition.org).

## How We Help

If you are traveling for an abortion from another city or state (or across a city), we can help ease your journey by booking your travel arrangements or reimbursing your gas money.

A MAC volunteer can meet you at the bus or train station and escort you to a volunteer's home where you will stay during your visit.

We’ll also help cover the costs of food, medication — and provide emotional support. It’s our goal to make your stay go as smoothly as possible.
