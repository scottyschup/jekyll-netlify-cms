<h4>Does MAC provide abortions?</h4>
<p>No, we do not. We assist with the other costs and difficulties associated with getting an abortion, including transportation and accommodation.</p>
 
<h4>Is MAC trans-inclusive?</h4>
<p>Yes, we most definitely are. We are fully aware that people of all kinds experience unwanted pregnancies and are supportive of choice. We go out of our way to ensure that everyone feels comfortable, understood, and supported.</p>

<h4>What if Iâ€™m a minor?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, those under the age of 18 must notify their parent or guardian in order to get an abortion under the law. For minors choosing to access abortion who do not want to tell their parents, the <a href="http://ilbypasscoordinationproject.org/">ACLU Judicial Bypass Project</a> can help.</p>
