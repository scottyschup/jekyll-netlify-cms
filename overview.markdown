<p><b>Illinois — and Chicago specifically — is a travel destination for pregnancy termination in the Midwest.</b> Compared to the surrounding states, Illinois has far few barriers to obtaining safe and skilled abortion care, as it does not subject people to a mandatory waiting period, forced ultrasounds, or misinformed consent. Illinois also has contraceptive equity, allows emergency contraceptives in emergency rooms, participates in stem cell research — and has not made efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.</p>

<p>As such, approximately 3,000 people travel to Chicago annually to receive abortion services. The hardships and costs of travel vary, but consider: <b>If a person is struggling to come up with enough money to pay the bare minimum for their procedure, how will they be able to pay for a train ticket, hotel, cabs, and food in an urban city?</b></p>

<p>The Midwest Access Coalition (MAC) aims to fill this gap. <em>Founded in 2014, MAC has served more than 300 people from 14 states. <b>We have never turned away a request.</b></em></p>

<h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3>
<p>We provide accommodation and support to those who travel to Chicago to access a safe, legal abortion when prohibitive legislation limits access closer to home. We envision a world in which all people have access to safe, free, legal abortions wherever they live.<p>
